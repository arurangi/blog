# About
Welcome on my blog! The goal of this project is to building an environment for my personal projects and articles to live on. And also to learn about the web.

I will start building it vanilla style than as I learn more I will implement frameworks, libraries and all those fun stuff. The idea being to learn by doing and understand the added value of all the useful abstraction we have in the web world.

### Current Focus
- building the 1st version of my portfolio page. Must be responsive, have 3 sections (about, project, contact). Only HTML and raw CSS for simplicity
### To-do
- [ ] use the rough-notation library to highligh certain keywords when the user first visits my page
- [ ] make it responsive (mobile, laptop, desktop and ipad)
- [ ] use custom domain name
