        <p> Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
            Some say in ice.<br>
            From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire<br>
            I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
            But if it had to perish twice,<br>
            I think I know enough of hate<br>
            To say that for destruction ice<br>
            Is also great<br>
            And would suffice.
