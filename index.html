            <h1 class="header_hero">Hello! I'm Ars√®ne.</h1>
            <p>I'm a <span class="kw_position">software engineer</span> based in Belgium. I like building <span class="kw_web">tools for the web</span> that are intuitive and delightful to use.</p>
            <p>I'm currently studying <strong>computer science</strong> at <span class="kw_school"><strong>42</strong></span>, which is a school without teachers, based on peer-to-peer learning and focused on projects. Prior to that, I studied <strong>electroacoustic music composition</strong>.</p>
            <p>Through these experiences, I had the opportunity to solve a variety of problems, contribute to  work on small and larger projects whether alone or in group settings, develop a user focused mindset, an attention to UX details, the habit of writing clean code, and the ability to learn and work in groups .</p>
            <p>Starting november 2023, I will be looking for an internship. <span class="cta">Hire me?</span></p>
