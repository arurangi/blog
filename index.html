        <h1>Designing a pleasent reading experience [in progress]</h1>
        <p>I always wanted to create a personal site where I would share my projects, articles, ideas and useful ressources I collected. The problem was that everytime I started, I would get overwhelmed by the amount of work it represents. From all the design decisions to the stack, the hosting and all the things involved in putting a site online.</p>
        <p>So to get over this paralysis, I decided to start small. To start by researching something that will be central to my blog, which is the rich-text</p>
        <p>So while I research this topic, I will publish this page and apply my findings on it.</p>
        <p>So at the end of this, I will have one page that looks and feels good.</p>

        <h2>What is rich-text and why it matters</h2>
